A living skeletrical centurion stands in front of you he want to fight and you cannot refuse, so you grab a random iron sword from the ground enchanted with sharpness I after taking the sword the skeleton rushes towards you and one shot you want to know why? is simple. He had full netherite gear how can you win this??

Something is not right in this room i feel a simp vibe in here i cant even narrate well here wait... IN FRONT OF YOU APPEAR A GODDES AND ITS DURANDAL(dudu for friends) she wants to offer her blessing(an umbrella?) to help you, so you accept it or not? just to clarify if you say no im gonna kill you with my own narrator hands >:(

choice: yes
you receive the Dudu's blessing maybe this can be usefull. It has to be!,(the player get the item called Dudu's blessing required to get to the end of the maze) there is a crossroads one way take you to a room called extremum proelium(the final battle) and the other one is called Felix natalis

You smell a repulsive smell of blood a giant armored troll is in here and he have already killed lots of soldier, you are scared and panicked to death but suddenly as the troll was going to hit you with his enormous axe the "umbrella" emmits an immense light that temporary blind you and the troll after some seconds the blind effect vanish and you are not alone anymore but THE BRO'S AND SIS ARE HERE TO HELP YOU DEFEAT THIS MOTHER FU****. The dudu's blessing summoned the whole teri tower server!, and the rusty iron sword is not here anymore it evolved in a light sword called EXCALIBUR enchanted with the power of friendship, so as the troll starts running again towards you, you do the same but this time with the power of friendship and by screaming loud EXCALIBUUUUUUUUR!!! as saber teached you in the past, and the troll evaporate almost instantly consumed by the light beam generated from your sword. The battle is over you type ez gg wp in chat and leaves the room but only after thanking dudu and the teri tower server that gave you the power to defeat the (MR)beast.
