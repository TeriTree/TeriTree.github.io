Returning to the grassy plains, Beerin presented its finding to Treeze
It seems that Treeze is pleased by the strange device, and he asked about where it came from 
Beerin then regaled him with tales of its adventures
Of the river, the creature and the strange rituals it partook in
Treeze was very curious about all of these strange things Beerin encountered
And they talked for what seemed like forever over what these things could mean
When Beerin mentioned its hive's teaching, Treeze paused
Then he asked Beerin why it decided to leave its hive, when it loved that hive so much
To this, Beerin answered that it wanted to hang out with Treeze
But surely, you can stay at the hive and still visit me, questioned Treeze
This gave the little Beerin a little pause
It was trying to come up with an answer, yet in its mind, there was simply blank space
Why? why did it decide to leave the hive? Beerin did not know
Finally, Beerin answered: you needed me more than the hive did
It was unsure if that was the real answer, but it said it nonetheless
After all, that was the only good explanantion
So that must have been what Beerin thought when it left the hive
It was the only explanation that made sense
Treeze hummed, and accepted the answer
Yet it seemed to the little Beerin that there was something still plaguing Treeze
Perhaps there was something wrong with its answer after all? Beerin did not know
Treeze did think about things a lot
Beerin always took him for someone who was not satisfied with just letting things be when there was still doubt
It made sense, somewhat. After all, it's not like there was much to do here except thinking
But even so, if Treeze would not voice his concerns to it, Beerin supposed it can't pry
Still, Beerin was unsettled
Why was its memories so jumbled? It remembered leaving the hive, yet it did not even remember why?
Perhaps it simply forgot since it was a long time ago, Beerin decided
No matter what the reason might have been, it had no bearings on the present anymore
And it moved on from the train of thought
No use lingering on what was long past, after all
The two continued conversing, until they had nothing to converse about
And Beerin departed once more
