Beerin flew, though its wings felt weak and its heart felt empty
Through grass fields and riversides and flower gardens
As Beerin came nearer and nearer, storm clouds began to gather
And it began raining, at first just a light drizzle, and it became more and more intense before Beerin could barely flap its wings a few times before almost being murdered by oncoming rainfall
There was thunder somewhere distant
Beerin carried on, it couldn't stop there
Until it arrived to the hive once more
It flew through the forcefield, and through the entrance
And it perched there, for a long while, until it had the courage to continue walking
Time to face the truth, the thing which Beerin had been denying all this time
But when it saw what was inside, Beerin's legs gave out
It did not have the strength to support itself and fell to the floor
This was the truth that Beerin had been so desperate to escape
In front of the bee, was the pollen filled corpses of its brethren
The hivelings,the vessel, even the strange blue thing
They were dead, all dead
All across the floor was pollen, unending pollen
Corpses scattered the halls, their eyes clouded with a sickly yellow
It was a horrible scene, but Beerin knew, it had seen this before
This was nothing new, and yet it still felt new nevertheless
That shock, that pain, it had been like Beerin had discovered this for the first time all over again
...Why?
Why?
And... Beerin remembered
It did not want to, but it remembered
Beerin remembered

And the wor l̶d̶     b̷   r̵ ̶    ̷ ̶ ̴o̵         ̵̖͗k̵ ̵               ̵e̷̒

Beerin awoke once again, though this time the scenery around it stayed the same this time
It wished it had all been a dream
Well, it was a dream, but the reality of what it had done was not
There was something that did change, though
Beerin remembered its body being healthy and hale
But at the moment, Beerin felt like its insides had been pierced through a thousand times
This was what that strange pollen does to bees, Beerin supposed
At the very least, it knew what the other hive members had gone through before dying
Unlike them, it seems that Beerin was still alive
For how much longer, Beerin did not know how 
This was all its fault, it thought
To think, that it had been the one to bring that pollen here
That it had been the one to doom the hive
That this had been brought about through its actions alone
And now, Beerin was the only one left
Is this repentment?
Is this pain, this suffering the price it alone is paying for causing the downfall of the hive?
If bees could weep, it would at this moment
But it layed there, staring, staring at the future it had created
As Beerin lay dying, all it could feel was regret
And to think, all this time Beerin had been attempting to escape the reality of its actions
It dared to dream of a world where it would not have to suffer, all while it's fellow hive members suffered and died
This is the truth, all of it
The inevitability it would have had to face, sooner or later
Perhaps Beerin thought that by staying in that dream, this future could simply.. not be
Out of sight, out of mind
How morbid, thought Beerin
Somehow, it made the bee want to scream and wail even more
That dream,...
was any of it real?
That grassy hill, that cloudless sunny sky, and that tree upon the hill
Were they real?
Beerin did not know
But Beerin, wanted... wanted to know
Perhaps even if its hive was dead, at least one friend on Beerin's could live on out there, perhaps not quite happy nor free, but alive
Alive and not doomed with this horrible fate by Beerin's actions
Treeze... perhaps...
Even if Beerin's heart was filled utterly with regret, it could die peacefully, after seeing its friend one last time
Beerin thought, even if Treeze was not the same as the one from the dream, it would still want to see him nonetheless
With the last of its strength, Beerin flapped its wings and flew
Its wings nearly failed many times along the journey, but it arrived at the grassy hill at last
But when Beerin looked ahead, all it could see was an empty hill where Treeze should have stood
As sickly yellow clouded Beerin's visioned, it screamed
Ah, Beerin thought, so this is the truth
It seems its pollen addled mind had invented Treeze after all
It had hope, that perhaps that Treeze had been based on someone real, someone who was still living
But it seems, if there was one thing Beerin's mind was good at, it was creating false hope
It wasn't real, none of it was ever real
Beerin was truly pathetic to have thought otherwise
It seems Beerin was right after all, there was never a Treeze to bring answers back to, because Treeze had always been a lie
A very cruel lie, that even made Beerin believe was living, was thinking, was real
Beerin screamed
For all it had done, screamed at the world for doing unto it this fate, at Treeze for making it believe it could have peace
Screamed at horrible the pollen, screamed at the storm, and screamed at itself 
Until Beerin could not scream any longer
Eventually its body gave up on it, and Beerin layed in the grass with its last flicker of life
Treeze, the hive, the queen, Beerin recounted everyone it knew
I'm sorry, was what Beerin thought, the very last thought it would ever have
And then it laid dead, never to wake again
