Returning to the grassy plains, Beerin presented its finding to Treeze
It seemed that Treeze is pleased by the spinning thing, and he asked about where it came from 
Beerin then regaled him with tales of its adventures
Of the gathering, of tree fashion and how it defeated a strange lumbering creature to get the spinning thing
Treeze was very curious about all of these strange things Beerin encountered
And they talked for what seemed like forever over what these things could mean
When Beerin mentioned the gathering, Treeze began to be curious
Do they always gather there?, he asked
No, was Beerin's reply, I have been there a few times and there were not as many lumbering creatures then
How strange, thought Treeze
Did they all come there together?, he asked
No, was Beerin's reply, i saw some arrived later on
Treeze hummed, and pondered, I wonder how they keep track of time, since they seem to know when the gathering was happening
Beerin laughed
They obviously used the cycle of night and day, it said
What is this cycle of day and night, asked Treeze
Beerin freezes, and looks over
When the sun sets and comes back again everyday, when it switches between night and day and day and night again?, was what it said back
But the sun never sets, said Treeze, it has stayed in the spot  on the sky for as long as i remember
Beerin became confused, and looked at the sun
Yes, it was still in the sky, in fact, it was in the same spot as the last time Beerin has seen it
And Beerin could not remember the last time it had been night, or even the last time the sun had been anywhere else but that spot in the sky
In fact, Beerin could not even remember why it thought that a day night cycle ever existed
That was where the sun stayed.... it always has been
The sun does not move, it never has
What was Beerin even talking about?
Nevermind, said Beerin to Treeze, I must have imgined something that wasn't there
Perhaps Beerin mistook something from a dream of its for something in reality
Treeze humed, and accepted the asnwer
But Beerin could tell that it still bothered Treeze
It did not blame him, this subject bothered it as well
Had Beerin always been such an airheaded person? It seemed like things had been slipping by it all too often lately
And now... inventing things that weren't real? And then acting like they were?
Beerin couldn't help but feel there was a hole where its head should be
Still, they both moved on, and talked about everything else until there was nothing to be talked about
And Beerin departed once again
