Beerin had seen a few grassfields with wild flowers on its travels before, but this is was something else entirely
Everywhere, from where it was perching, to beyond the horizon, there were only flowers
A sea filled only with golden flowers
In short, a bee's heaven
Beerin was in fact, so entranced by the flower field, that it frolicked around for hours and hours
Perhaps it was simply the nature of bees, to be distracted by flowers, but Beerin forgot its original mission
So it buzzed around until it didn't have the strength to anymore
So Beerin perched on one of the leaves, and took a nap
It was a deep sleep, and after a while, Beerin woke up
But something was different, now
It seemed that while Beerin was sleeping, it had begun to rain
The sky, which was previously perfectly clear, was now covered with dark clouds
And from the heavens came large drops of water
It was less of a drizzle, and more of a complete downpour
How did I sleep through such a big storm?, thought Beerin
Indeed, it was rather unusual, that Beerin had not been awoken prior to this, considering the intensity of the rain
Somewhere near, it heard a terrible thunder
Beerin fled immediately
For some strange reason, Beerin was struck by an strange terror
Beyond just a survival instinct of wanting to flee storms, Beerin felt as though its entire body has been gripped with fear
It was like Beerin had seen something like this before
Beerin took use of the grass, since flying normally would put it at risk of being hit by rainfall
It weaved and dodged, but eventually managed to escape to the one place it knew would be safe: the hive
The hive had a protective barrier, and as Beerin thought, it was strong enough to ward off the storm
It had been a while since Beerin returned to the hive, so naturally it was reluctant
However, the situation demanded this of it, and Beerin had no other choice
But when Beerin entered the hive to greet its former hivemates,....
The wor l̶d̶     b̷   r̵ ̶    ̷ ̶ ̴o̵         ̵̖͗k̵ ̵               ̵e̷̒
Beerin woke up, once again in the field of flowers
How strange, it thought
The sky was clear again, the sun was once again in the position it always occupied, and there was no rain in sight
Was that a dream?, wondered Beerin, such a strange dream it was
Beerin flew up from the leaf it was perching on
All seemed well again. No indication of rain or it ever having rained previously
Beerin hummed, it supposed that it must have all been conjured up by its mind
Thus Beerin picked a lone flower, and headed back to Treeze
Even though its mind was plagued by thoughts of that dream the entire way back
