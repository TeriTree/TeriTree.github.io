These rivers sure were nice looking, thought Beerin
Watching them flow by slowly was very calm and relaxing
And how the water glittered in sunlight, the way it turned a brilliant white color
It was rather mezmerizing to look at
It was shame, yes, a great shame indeed, that Treeze could not come to look at this river
And when Beerin came near, it could see a double of it in the flowing water
Perhaps there was a different Beerin living a similar life underwater, pondered Beerin
Perhaps there was a river Treeze somewhere as well
It was shame, yes, a great shame indeed, that Treeze can not come to look at this river
Beerin would bring the river to Treeze, if it could, but alas, though Beerin was powerful and strong, controlling the path of rivers was not within its jurisdiction
Looking at the clone Beerin in the water, Beerin wanted to cross the water to the other side, but it remembered the bee hive's teaching, and how going into bodies of water was forbidden
At the memory of its hive, Beerin stopped
How strange, that it would still obey the hive's teachings when it lived with them no longer
Perhaps there is a part of it that still wished to go back after all
But the hive was then, and this was now
The hive would be fine living without it living by their side
But Beerin would heed their words nonetheless
Perhaps, even when that chapter of life has gone and went by, it could still cherish the memories made there
Beerin decided to resist the temptation to go into the water and pull out a clone Beerin 
Now to look for something to bring back, it thinks
Thus Beerin buzzes around the edge of the river, going in the direction it flowed
Until it saw a figure in the distance.
A lumbering creature. It was many times larger than Beerin
It stood upright, and held a strange device near its head
Out of curiosity, Beerin flies over to look at what the creature was looking at
To its shock, it was a mini world, identical to the world it was inhabitating
The world looked the same as outside, from the grass, to the sky, to the river
But in the mini world, everything was still
Beerin had a revelation. Perhaps it could bring a river to Treeze after all
This device, it held inside a river, but was small, and it was something Beerin could pick up
Surely Treeze would be very happy to have a river at where he stayed
Thus Beerin docked on the grass nearby and awaited its oppurtunity 
As the creature sat down, and sat the device aside, Beerin began making its move
The creature was busy doing something with a white thing
Beerin was unsure what, but the creature was staining the white thing with tiny black symbols
Perhaps this was a strange ritual of some kind, Beerin decided, and took the river holding device
It hid among the grass for a long time, slowly making its way away from the strange lumbering creature
And homewards Beerin went
