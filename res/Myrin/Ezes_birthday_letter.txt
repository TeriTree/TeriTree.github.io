Hallo Eze :D
Happy birthday, or. well. Happy late birthday, i suppose. I want you to know that you're a very dear friend of mine. Talking to you is always fun, whether it's about philosophy or games. It's always been super engaging to chat with you and you always brighten my day a lot. And I wanted to do something nice, since it's your birthday. Well, near enough to your birthday, anyways. This was what I ended up coming up with.
I hope you liked the story i wrote. As you can probably tell, it was a fanfiction of your fanfiction. Fanficception, if you will. I really loved what you wrote for my birthday, so naturally, i couldn't give you anything for your birthday except my own interpretation of your story ._. I would say i hope you weren't too bummed out by the ending, but that would be lying, considering that i wrote that ending specifically to bum you out. I hope that story didn't scar you for life?
I actually wanted to write something from Treeze's perspective, where he figures out slowly that he was living in a dream world and he himself is just a figment of Beerin's imagination. But since I made Treeze, well, a tree, it was just too hard, since then the entire story would just be Treeze and Beerin talking to eachother. And I wasn't sure how to give that story an ending. That's why you ended up reading what you did. Of course, that was before i found out you were a bee/tree/philosopher, but oh well. If you were one of the bees you would have died anyways.
If you can, please write back to me whenever to tell me what you thought of the story, since I am absolutely dying to know. Or not, idk maybe you're busy. Other than that, have a nice day :D
Sincerely, Myra
