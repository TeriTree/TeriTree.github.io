These gatherings sure were crouded. Those big, lumbering creatures love to gather here
Beerin would not blame them, since here was a place of many colors
Like water flowing from a high thin cliff, streams of colors lay nested above these strange poles
They flowed down below, and yet stayed suspended in air
and the tail ends seemed to be flowing in wind
When Beerin landed on one of these color waterfalls, it was astounded to see that it is solid
It was not like the streams of water that would have surely flooded it away by now
Beerin wondered then, if Treeze would like one of these things as decoration
There were a few trees here that seem to have them already
Perhaps it was a fashion statement
Beerin wondered if Treeze liked fashion
Did Treeze even know what fashion was?
Maybe not, since it was the only person around who went to visit Treeze nowadays
There was a weird blue thing at some point, but Beerin guessed it got tired of visiting eventually
Treeze couldn't even look at himself, since there are no lakes around the grass field, and it never rained, so it wasn't as if any kind of puddle can form either
There was the mini lake holding device, but the lake inside was quite small, and did not have a mini river Treeze
So perhaps fashion would not be the biggest of priorities
Beerin thought again
What else could it bring back? Food? A shiny rock? One of those paper things the big lumbering creatures seem to carry around?
Suddenly, Beerin was distracted
Out of its field of vision, one of the smaller of the big lumbering creatures was carrying something
It was.... well. Beyond Beerin's ability to describe, really
It was a stick, and on the end, there was a spinning thing
That spinny thing had four colors, and they spun around very prettily
Yes, thought Beerin, I will bring that back to Treeze
And he would be very pleased, the little bee was sure of that
Thus Beerin buzzed over to the creature, and docked on the handle
It attempted to pull the spinning thing from the creature's grip
Hovever, Beerin could not manage it
Yet when the lumbering creature looked down at Beerin, it let out a small scream, and flung the spinning thing, along with Beerin, to the ground
As Beerin looked up back at the creature from where it sat on the ground, it realized the creature was running away
A decisive victory for the little Beerin, it decided
The little Beerin grabs onto the spinning thing, and begins its return to the grassy plain where Treeze resided
